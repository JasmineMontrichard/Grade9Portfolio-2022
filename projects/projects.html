                    These are projects that I have started since last summer. As I look back
                    on my previous projects I am really proud of how far I've come.

                    Thanks to the early college program I am currently enrolled in called P-TECH, it allowed
                    me to create these projects and prepare before going into post-secondary education. I am
                    grateful I was able to take an amazing opportunity that other students may not usually get.

                    This was my first personal project I made during P-TECH's summer CODEfest. I learned
                    some basics of HTML from an app called Mimo. I don't use it anymore since I've
                    learned a lot quicker in P-TECH's HTML/CSS courses.

                    This is another project I had to make while taking my first HTML course. This course helped fill the
                    the gaps in my knowledge and I learned a lot more than what was provided in the learning app I used
                    to learn. Looking back at it I liked the theme but the moment I looked at it, I realized that my
                    code could be a lot more efficient. Maybe a rewrite would be nice.

                    My father asked me to help him with an Arduino project. He dealt with the hardware while I was
                    responsible for
                    creating the programs. I started this project maybe a month or so after finishing the P-TECH Java
                    course. Since
                    I learned how to display basic graphics in my Java course, I pretty much knew how it would work.

                    The goal was to create a working indicator on a small display triggered by sensors (for wind speed,
                    temperature, etc.)
                    and/or having a small amount of voltage being sent. This was just a test to see how the sensors and
                    display would
                    be programmed so we can move our program onto a larger display.
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p class="flex-item">
                    After we finished the first program, we moved on to make 2 other programs that displayed wind speed
                    and ground speed
                    on a round meter that were eventually merged into one program to work on dual displays.
                </p>
                <p class='flex-item'>
                    The whole project probably took less than a month. I had to program in C# or something, but it
                    wasn't much different
                    than Java. We eventually finished our prototype but unfortunately the project had to be put on hold
                    until further notice.

                    Technically, the only program I actually made from scratch was the program you see in the image below. 
                    I didn't make the programs from scratch but I used program files that my father found on the internet 
                    and combined them to create working indicators.

                <p class='flex-item'>
                    Overall, I am really grateful that I was able to learn the basics of Java early. It is always nice
                    to get a
                    head start into something. This made me feel more comfortable to try out other things such as
                    potential programming/robotics
                    competitions and more complex personal projects.

                    I started this project because I felt that I needed to brush up on my programming in Java. I believe
                    this was after participating
                    in my school board's annual programming competition. In 2 days, I managed to create a basic program
                    that would take data from
                    either file input or by the user manually giving data. Then I decided to make it into a command line
                    that can run a program when
                    the user types in a command. Today, it is still incomplete. However, I learned how to create, read
                    and write to files in Java.

                  I learned a lot from my instructors within the P-TECH program. They helped me take more steps towards achieving my goal. Without them, 
                  I wouldn't have been the person I am today.
