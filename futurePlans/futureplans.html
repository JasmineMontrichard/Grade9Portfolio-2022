                    Planning ahead is a big step towards success. It helps you narrow down what
                    needs to be done and think about the potential outcomes of a decision. It is 
                    a good way to come prepared for whatever might happen. Time is most valuable, 
                    so we should use it carefully.

                            My goal is to try and do well in school and participate in events that benefit myself before
                            going into university. It would also be to take courses that
                            can benefit me while going into Computer Science or Artifical Intelligence Engineering. I
                            hope that I can push myself so that I can become successful.

                            I will also realized I needed to use options such as Night School or Summer School to hopefully
                            all the courses I want to take in the rest of my four years of high school.

                            Currently, I am planning to become an AI Engineer, or a Software Engineer as an alternative.
                            I'm interested in contributing to the development of AI and the development and maintenance 
                            of new software.
                        </p>
                        <p class='flex-item'>
                            I am excited to see how far AI will go for as long as I'm alive, but there are some ethical
                            concerns about AI that worry me such as:
                        </p>
                        <ul class='flex-item'>
                            <li><b>Technological Singularity</b> — where AI becomes uncontrollable</li>
                            <li><b>AI's Decision-Making</b> — such as the disregard of life or things to achieve it's
                                goal</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p class='flex-item'>
                            It will probably take decades or centuries
                            for any of these to become a serious threat to humanity, but I wouldn't be here by the time 
                            it might happen.
                        </p>
                        <p class='flex-item'>
                            Fortunately since 2021, countries around the world are effectively creating a plan to protect 
                            humanity from the danger of AI, and that's what is important.
                        </p>

                        <p class='flex-item'>
                            I am considering the universities and courses that I might want to take after graduating
                            from high school. The dream university that I want to go to is
                            the University of Toronto. If I am not accepted, some alternatives might be McMaster
                            University or University of Waterloo. I would like to be able to take courses
                            for Artificial Intelligence Engineering or Computer Science.
                        </p>
                        <p class='flex-item'>
                            However, for AI Engineering I would have to take a lot of heavy courses such as Grade 12 math and 
                            science. It is most likely I would be subjected to take a gap year which I don't find preferable. 
                            Hopefully, I will be able to fit my chosen courses into the rest of my four years of high school 
                            while taking Summer and Night School.

                <p class='flex-item'>
                    A brief look on my schedule of what my average week looks like. I really hope I can use my time more
                    efficently with my "social media blocks" such as using it for a new hobby, more coding or learning something 
                    new. I also want to lessen procrastination and improve my productivity.

                <p class='flex-item'>
                    It won't be easy but I promise myself that by after school ends I will improve on myself.

                        I would like to give a special thank you to the organizers, teachers and partners of the P-TECH program! They gave students the opportunity to be 
                        prepared for a career in technology, a field that has jobs growing rapidly in demand each year. Fast-paced learning 
                        in hardware and programming helped me and other admitted students develop the skills that we can use to become successful.
                    </p>
                    <p class='flex-item'>
                        I really hope that I can succeed and take available opportunities to learn and apply my knowledge to my future career. Even if things turn out not 
                        as I've wanted to, there is always an alternative path that I can take. I will always stand by this quote that I saw 
                        in one of my P-TECH classes:
                    </p>
