                    My experience as a first-year high school student has been amazing. I met a lot of new people and my
                    enrollment into an early college program has gave me a lot of opportunities.
                </p>
                <p class='flex-item'>
                    Below is a brief timeline of the highlighted experiences I have had this year.

                <h1 class='flex-item'>My Grade 9 P-TECH Experience</h1>
                <p class='flex-item'>
                    At the start of July, all new Grade 9 students in SJB's P-TECH program were invited to the virtual
                    Summer CODEfest 2021. This event provided students the chance to get to know each other and participate 
                    in activites that give a brief introduction to HTML/CSS. There was also a weekly draw for the month, 
                    where the winner would receive a 300$ gift card of their choice. I really liked that we had a beginner's 
                    grasp at what we would learn in our P-TECH courses.
                </p>
                <p class='flex-item'>
                    Throughout the school year, my P-TECH class and I learned math, web development, Java, and hardware. Our 
                    courses were fast-paced to make sure we get our college diploma before graduating high school. Although 
                    I enjoy learning what the P-TECH program has to offer, I find that it also means you will also not be 
                    getting as many electives as usual. Overall, I enjoy being in the program and I am not planning to leave 
                    anytime soon!

                <h2 class='flex-item'>April 2022</h2>
                <p class='flex-item'>
                    This was my first programming competition. This was organized by other secondary school business and
                    computer departments within our school board. Most of the participants were in Grades 10-12 while few 
                    were in Grade 9. All teams that represented each school had 3 hours to complete 4 problems in the quickest 
                    time. I was kind of bummed out I only had one teammate but this was our first time competiting in a 
                    programming competition.
                </p>
                <p class='flex-item'>
                    I learned that I would need to prepare a lot more especially since I was going up against those who
                    have programmed for more than a year now. However, this contest gave me more experience and a reminder 
                    to keep practising. Although we did not win, I enjoyed representing the school and I am willing to come 
                    back next year for the next competition!
